											<h2>Joanne Park BACP Registered and Accredited Counsellor</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My experience as a counsellor began when I qualified in 2010. I have gained experience in a variety of settings including the NHS, mental health charities and employee assistance programmes (EAP). I have also worked in the charity sector since 2006 facilitating mental health support groups and courses. A great deal of my experience as a counsellor and supervisor came from 11 years working in a mental health charity as a counsellor and counselling service coordinator, managing the counselling service and a team of qualified and trainee counsellors.</p>
										<p>I’m a registered and accredited member of the British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP). I work as an integrative counsellor, adapting my approach to meet the individual needs of each client. The foundation of my approach is Person Centred Therapy; I also draw from Transactional Analysis (TA) and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). I can assist with a variety of issues including, but not limited to, anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, domestic abuse, family conflict, relationship difficulties, bereavement, and workplace stress.</p>
										<p>Currently, alongside my private practice, I work as a Counselling Associate for a local organisation providing counselling for employees of local organisations who need support.</p>
										<p>I'm qualified to provide counselling supervision for qualified and trainee counsellors. More details can be found in the 'Supervision' section of this website.</p>

									<h2>Counselling</h2>

								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images\iStock-2166850465.jpg" alt="" /></span>I will provide a non-judgemental and confidential space to talk. I can help you to explore and find ways to cope with issues, thoughts and emotions that are having negative impact on your life. I will support you to build resilience and confidence as you take steps towards a more fulfilling and happier life. Please see the ‘About me’ page on this website for more details about my experience and the issues I can support you with.</p>
								<p>Counselling sessions will last for 50 minutes. In terms of the number of sessions required, there is no 'one size fits all' and this will be regularly reviewed. Depending on the issues brought to counselling, some clients can feel much better after few sessions whereas some clients require more than six sessions to feel more able to cope.</p>
